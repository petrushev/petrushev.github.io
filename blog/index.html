        <p>The European commission ruled that deals between Apple and the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid. Apple has been ordered to pay up to €13bn in back taxes to Ireland.</p>
<p>According to the commission, the taxable profits of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe did not correspond to economic reality. Apple paid an effective tax rate of 1% in 2003 on profits of Apple Sales International, the rate dropped to 0.005% in 2014.</p>

        <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a lawsuit claiming the parts of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that deal with copy protection and digital locks are unconstitutional. DMCA became law in 1998, making it a federal crime to copy a DVD or anything that breaks digital copy-protection schemes.</p>
<p>The digital locks, often referred to as digital rights management or DRM, were often extended or used to curtail free speech, journalistic or scientific research, cultural participation and digital security.</p>

        <p>Researchers in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory had created an algorithm that analyzes video, then uses what it learns to predict how humans will behave.</p>
<p>The machine was fed six-hundred hours of clips from shows like The Office and Big Bang Theory and learned to identify high-fives, handshakes, hugs, and kisses. When tests were run, the algorithm correctly predicted future interactions 43% of the time.</p>

        <p>Ross Ulbricht, the founder and operator of dark net's biggest marketplace for narcotics called Silk Road, was arrested in October 2013 and charged with money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, and procuring murder. Recently, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on all the charges but the one of procuring murder.</p>
<p>Ulbricht started the marketplace back in 2010, with free market ideology as his driving ideal. In time, while enforcing its rules and principles, Ulbricht turned into a criminal. Both the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the FBI had their investigations as early as 2011.</p>
<p>At the time of the arrest, the FBI seized 144,000 bitcoins which belonged to Ulbricht, worth $28.5 million. The seizure had a large impact on bitcoin's exchange rate at that time. The website was shut down shortly after that.</p>

        <p>PyPy is Python implemented in Python. This means that the interpreter is written in Python, but what started as an experimental idea turned into a fast, efficient Python implementation with a JIT compiler that has the potential to implement other dynamic interpreted languages as well.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Python 2 specification is done in RPython – the so-called restricted Python, which is a stripped down version. The constraints that RPython has on objects make it easier to infer their types. The PyPy tool chain then has an easy time translating the RPython program to C, JVM bytecode or CIL. It also builds a JIT compiler in the resulting interpreter.</p>
<p>PyPy is capable of running any common Python code.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>First and foremost – speed. PyPy's website maintains a page that's updated at each PyPy version which contains the accomplishments – various benchmarks and how much faster it is than those compared with CPython. These are kinda assumed, [. . .]
